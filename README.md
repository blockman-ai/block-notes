# Block Notes

**Block Notes** is a decentralized notebook on Bitcoin.

Every block is a canvas for expression — a memory, a quote, a prayer, or a moment in history.  
Inscribe your thoughts forever using simple on-chain text.

## How It Works

To claim a block note, inscribe a message like this:

```text
block-note:840000
"Today I begin again. Thank you, Bitcoin." – @blockman-ai
